# Pinocchio

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ncuesta/pinocchio.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ncuesta/pinocchio)

Annotated Source generator for PHP (port of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco)). This library has been
inspired by [Phrocco](https://github.com/oneblackbear/phrocco).

**Pinocchio** crawls the source files on a project and automatically generates
annotated source HTML pages that serve both as self-documented projects and
API-like documentation.

You may see the [annotated source of **Pinnochio**](http://ncuesta.github.com/pinocchio/docs/index.html), for an example.

## Key benefits

* Easy to use
* Almost no requirements (only PHP >= 5.3.6)
* Configurable and customizable
* Makes projects self-documented

## Installation

You can install **Pinocchio** using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). It is
more likely that you'll use **Pinocchio** as a development library and not as
one that will actually be required for the use of your project, so you might
want to use it as a `dev` requirement in your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "ncuesta/pinocchio": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Once you have that, you can `install` it providing the `--dev` flag:

```bash
$ composer install --dev
```

If Composer complains about stability issues, you might need to add a `minimum-stability`
key to the `composer.json` file like follows:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "ncuesta/pinocchio": "dev-master"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

## Usage

Once installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) you can use **Pinocchio**
directly from the command-line interface as follows. Please note that
`vendor/bin/pinocchio` is the path to **Pinocchio**'s executable, and that
`vendor/bin` is the directory in which [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
installs any vendor binary files by default. If you have changed this path,
be sure that you are running **Pinocchio** from your specific one.

So, running:

```bash
$ php vendor/bin/pinocchio
```

will crawl for any source files under `./src` directory and will generate their corresponding annotated source files under `./output`. See below for further
customization of this behavior.

## Configuration

**Pinocchio** can be configured in many ways. You can provide your configuration
options when running the script, have your settings taken from a configuration
file located on the root of your project, or a combination of both.

The order in which option sources are considered is:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Configuration file values
3. Default values

### Configuration options

Here is a list of all the configuration options and their acceptable values:

* `source` (`string`): The path to the source directory to crawl
  for sources.
* `output` (`string`): The path to the output directory in which generated
  files will be saved.
* `template` (`string`): The path to the template to use for each source
  file.
* `css` (`array`): A set of CSS files to use inside the template.
* `ignore` (`string`): A regular expression that if matched by any path
  inside the `source` directory, will exclude such path from the crawled files.
* `silent` (`boolean`): A value indicating whether the logger should be silent
  or output things.
* `logger` (`string`): A fully-qualified class name to use as Logger class.
  This class _should_ implement `\Pinocchio\Logger\LoggerInterface`.
* `logger_opts` (`array`): A set of options that will be provided to the Logger
  upon its initialization. Note that the default Logger class does not take any
  option into account.
* `skip_index` (`boolean`): If `true`, no index file will be generated. Otherwise,
  an `index.html` file will be created at the `output` directory with links to the
  different files, as presented in the `index_template` template.
* `index_template` (`string`): The path to the template to use for the index file.
  Only applicable when `skip_index` is `true`.
* `index_title` (`string`): The title to add to the index file.

### Configuration as arguments

When running **Pinocchio** you can pass arguments that will be considered as
configuration options. For instance:

```bash
$ php vendor/bin/pinocchio --source src --output annotated-source
```

Will tell **Pinocchio** that the `source` option has been set to `src` and
`output` to `annotated-source`.

### Configuration file

If a file named `pinocchio.json` is found at the directory in which you invoke
**Pinocchio** (namely your project's root), it will be used as an configuration
source. For instance:

```json
{
    "source":   "lib",
    "output":   "doc",
    "template": "path/to/some/template.php",
    "css":      ["stylesheet_1.css", "path/to/stylesheet_2.css"],
    "ignore":   "/ignore\s+me\s+regex/i",
    "silent":   true
}
```

### Default values

All configuration values have a sensible default value so that you *don't have to*
configure anything. Here is a list of all the default values for the different
configuration options:

* `source`: `'src'`.
* `output`: `'output'`.
* `template`: A built-in template based on [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco)'s template.
* `css`: A built-in stylesheet based on [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco)'s stylesheet.
* `ignore`: `'/^\./'`. Dot-files are ignored by default.
* `silent`: `false`. Everything is logged by default. Don't worry, it's not *that* verbose.
* `logger`: `'\Pinocchio\Logger\StandardLogger'`. Default class, you can specify a fully-qualified
  one if you want. Please note that it should implement `\Pinocchio\Logger\LoggerInterface`.
* `logger_opts`: `[]` (an empty array). No options are provided to the logger by default.
* `skip_index`: `false`.
* `index_template`: A built-in template that simply links to every parsed source file.
* `index_title`: `'Source files'`.
